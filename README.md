# BeneFit
The BeneFit socket is an adjustable temporary socket for a transradial prosthesis. With this temporary socket, that can be adjusted in its length and diameter, it should be possible to fit different patients with a few quick adaptations and thereby provide them with the opportunity to make their first contact with a prosthesis, until an individual prosthesis can be provided.
In this repository you can find the 3D version of the first design, in multiple file formats as well a Diploma Thesis describing the design, construction and evaluation of the BeneFit socket.
If you use this design, please use "Baumgartner, Benedikt Laurens. Design of an Adjustable Temporary Socket for a Transradial Prosthesis. Wien, 2022." as a reference and link the repository.
